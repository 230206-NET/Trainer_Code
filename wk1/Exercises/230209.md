## Exercise: Hangman Game
Practice string manipulation and OOP by making a hangman game console application

- It should present the user with a word to guess (either random, or hard code)
- Allow users to select/enter a letter
- It should display number of letters as blank spaces
- If the user guesses the letter correctly, it should fill in those blank spaces
- It should draw the hangman, or at the very least have a limited number of tries
- It should validate the user input that it is an alphabet (and not a special character, whitespace, number, etc.)
- If the user guesses the word correctly, it should end the game ("you got it, congrats!")
- If the user makes too many incorrect guesses, it also should end the game ("whomp whomp.. perhaps next time")
