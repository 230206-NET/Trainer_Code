# 2023 02 10 Exercise
## Week 1 Hackathon
As teams of 3, you'll build a simple console based game and integrate to your collection of all the other projects you've built this week. We'll do a show and tell of your games next Monday(2/13/23)!

## Requirements
- Your game must be console based
- It must be simple enough to complete in an hour or two (the coding part, not the playing part)

- Your game project must be a separate C# project from your collection, or "wrapper" project
- You must import the game and others by using project reference
- Each of your projects that are not the "wrapper" project must be Class Library, and not produce an executable (.exe) file (so not console app)
- Each project should have their own namespace
- Finally, they should all belong in one solution
