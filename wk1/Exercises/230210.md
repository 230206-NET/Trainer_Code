# 2023 02 10 Exercise
## Week 1 Hackathon
As teams of 3, you'll build a simple console based game and integrate to your collection of all the other projects you've built this week. We'll do a show and tell of your games next Monday(2/13/23)!

## Requirements
- Your game must be console based
- It must be simple enough to complete in an hour or two (the coding part, not the playing part)

- Your game project must be a separate C# project from your collection, or "wrapper" project
- You must import the game and others by using project reference
- Each of your projects that are not the "wrapper" project must be Class Library, and not produce an executable (.exe) file (so not console app)
- Each project should have their own namespace
- Finally, they should all belong in one solution

## Teams
- Team 1: Artur, Georges, Melanie
- Team 2: Raj, Jacob, Nick
- Team 3: Edwin, John R, Patrick
- Team 4: Engels, John S, Samuel
- Team 5: Eric, Meet, Sonya

## To incorporate a project to another project...
0. In your console app project, have a menu to select which program the user wants to run
1. Make sure the project you're trying to incorporate is a class library (aka delete the <OutputType>exe</OutputType> in csproj file)
2. In your class library project, set up a namespace
3. Ensure you have no top-level-statements (aka, create a class and a method and put all your tls's there)
4. Add the project reference (using `dotnet add reference rel-path-to-folder-containing-csproj`)
    - to the console app's csproj (aka the project that is depending on the class library)
5. import the namespace via `using` directive
6. instantiate the class
7. Invoke the method that's containing the application logic

## Solution
Solution acts as a wrapper for projects that work together to create an application
- To create new solution `dotnet new sln -n slnName`
- to add existing project to a solution `dotnet sln add rel-path-to-sln`
