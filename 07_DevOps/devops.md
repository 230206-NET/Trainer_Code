## CI/CD
- CI: Continuous Integration
    - Let's continuously integrate newly written code to our main/dev branch w/o all manual review
    - Automate build, test, code quality check 

- CD - Deployment to Production "let's automate deploy process"
    - Continuous Delivery
        - Stops at deployment to staging environment and will wait for manual (human) approval for production deploy
    - Continuous Deployment
        - Goes all the way to production deployment automatically
