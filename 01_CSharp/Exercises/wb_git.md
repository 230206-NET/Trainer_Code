# Workbook: Git 

## Git Exercises
### Exercise One (Initializing and Basic Git Workflow)
1. Create a new empty repository in our github organization with the name first-last-code
2. Clone the repository to your local machine 
    - please remember where you're cloning this to in your local machine. You'll need to be able to find it in your file system
    -  It would be advisable to create a folder just for housing coding or training projects, if you haven't already
3. Create a new file called yourname.txt inside the repository and write a quick introduction about you
4. stage your new file
5. commit your staged changes

### Exercise Two (Pushing and Pulling)
We'll be working with the same repo from the exercise one
1. push the commit to your remote repository in github
2. You should be able to see the file you created on your github repository.
3. Go to the Remote repository on github that we just created 
4. Click on Add file and Create new file from the drop down
5. Name the file hobbies.txt and add a short blurb about your hobbies.
6. Once done, scroll to the bottom of the page and ensure you've selected "Commit directly to the main branch"
7. Click Commit new file
8. Navigate to your local repository 
9. Pull the changes from remote repo to local repo.
10. You should see the new file you created (hobbies.txt) appear in your local repository

### Exercise Three (Branching and Pull Requests)
We'll still be working with the same repository
1. In your local repository, create a new branch. Name it "interesting-facts"
2. Navigate to the new branch in your local repository
3. In your yourname.txt file, add one or more interesting facts about yourself
4. Stage and Commit all your changes (with a meaningful commit message, such as "added one hundred interesting facts about myself.")
5. Push this branch to your remote repo with the same branch name. 
6. On the upper left corner, click on the dropdown that says "main" You should be able to see the new branch you just pushed.
7. Click on Pull requests tab underneath your repository title (it's on the top of the page)
8. Click the green New pull request button
9. Review that below Compare changes, it reads base:main <- compare: interesting-facts. If not, click the compare dropdown to change it to an appropriate branch. 
10. Click Create pull request
11. Review the title and description of the new PR and click Create Pull Request button
11. Review the PR and click Merge pull request button
12. You should be able to see the changes and commits you made in your interesting-facts in your main branch
