# Linq (Language Integrated Query)

LINQ offers ability to Query datasets, regardless of what they are, as long as they implement IEnumerable or IQueryable

Linq methods are available through System.Linq namespace, and they are extension methods

Selling point of linq is that it can interact with various data structures regardless of their source in a UNIFORM fashion

you can use two types of syntax with LINQ: Method and Query syntax. [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/query-syntax-and-method-syntax-in-linq)
