# Trainer Code

Welcome to the one and only, totally official, greatest of all time repo of things you need during your training with Revature as part of the 230206-NET batch.

Fair warning to anyone not in the batch, this repo (and the whole organization really) will make almost no sense. You're going to want some context. And if you stumble across any of this while you're  searching for resources while going through your own training: 

Hi there!  
Feel free to look around, but remember, you don't get anything for free. Just copying files and hoping that they'll work, or that you can turn them in as your own work for a project is a BAD PLAN. Your trainer will know, and it will NOT go well for you. You have the entire internet, the sum total of all  human knowledge at your fingertips. Don't waste it being lazy! Just search for the topic you want to learn about, and put a little effort into learning how to do something for yourself!

Good Luck!  
Richard

This change is only on the Dev branch!
